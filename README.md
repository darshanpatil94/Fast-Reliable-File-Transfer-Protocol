# Fast-Reliable-File-Transfer-Protocol

Fast, Reliable File Transfer (C, Linux)
• Part-1: Designed a customized file transfer protocol with a transfer rate of ~60Mbps. (Link speed 100Mbps, Packet loss 20%). Integrated File reliability by implementing MD5 checksum Validation.
• Part-2: Modified TCP module in the Linux kernel to improve TCP Performance over lossy links. Achieved Transfer rate of ~9Mbps (Link speed 100Mbps, Delay 200ms, Packet loss 20%) which is 5 times faster than existing TCP implementations for Linux.
